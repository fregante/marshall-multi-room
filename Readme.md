# marshall-multi-room

Personal, incomplete no-UI "app" to control my [Marshall Acton Multi Room](https://www.marshallheadphones.com/us/en/acton-multi-room.html) WiFi speaker on my Mac since they only offer an [iOS app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/marshall-multi-room/id1200408306).

Uses Electron to reliably register the global keyboard shortcuts.
